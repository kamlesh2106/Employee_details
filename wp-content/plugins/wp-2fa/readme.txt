== Installing WP 2FA ==

###From within WordPress

1.  Navigate to ‘Plugins > Add New’
2.  Search for ‘WP 2FA’
3.  Install & activate WP 2FA from your Plugins page
  
###Manually

1.  Download the plugin from the WordPress plugins repository
2.  Unzip the zip file and upload the folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
3.  Activate the WP 2FA plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The first-time install wizard allows you to setup 2FA on your website and for your user within seconds.
2. The wizards make setting up 2FA very easy, so even non technical users can setup 2FA without requiring help.
3. You can require users to enable 2FA and also give them a grace period to do so.
4. Users can also use one-time codes via email as a two-factor authentication method.
5. You can use policies to require users to instantly set up and use 2FA, so the next time they login they will be prompted with this.
6. You can give users a grace period until they configure 2FA. You can also specify what should the plugin do once the grace period is over.
7. It is recommended for all users to also generate backup codes, in case they cannot access the primary device.
8. In the user profile users only have a few 2FA options, so it is not confusing for them and everything is self explanatory.

	* Require 2FA on user reset password.
	* CSS editor for the 2FA code page, allowing users to also apply their CSS to the 2FA login page.

	* Removed all third party's admin notices from the plugin settings pages.
	* The 2FA usage reports have also been improved so they report accurate numbers on a multsite network.
	* Improved a number of error and users messages in the plugin.
	* Updated the CSS of the backup codes wizard page to have the buttons all in one line.
	* Plugin now automatically removes the extra space at the end of the one-time code if entered in the 2FA code prompt.
